Yet limited efforts have been put in the development of a green maritime

						Catch a bubble!</h2>
						<h4>SeaBubbles will be like the Yellow cab in NYC. But with a few big differences.<br>
It is Green, It is fun and it is safe. And you will not get stuck in traffic.<br>
It will be great to live in such city where you can commute in and out using this new modern way of
transport.</h4>
